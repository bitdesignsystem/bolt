# Bolt Docs: Developer Filing an Issue

1. Please briefly describe the issue being encountered.
2. Which components / demos / component examples / variations is this issue affecting? 
	* Is this a breakpoint-specific issue or issue the issue happening at all screen sizes?
3. Which browsers / browser versions / devices / OSs are having this particular issue?

> Note: saying a browser version is  `the latest` is fine if you know your browser is up to date.

4. Which branch(es) are seeing this issue?
	* On a feature-specific branch?
	* Master? ex. https://master.boltdesignsystem.com
	* The latest release branch? (ie. latest hotfix release) https://release-1-x.boltdesignsystem.com
	* The latest minor release tag? https://v1-5-0.boltdesignsystem.com
	
> To put this another way â€” is this issue *visibly broken* **everywhere** this component is used? Or does it work fine in some places?

5. Is this a regression? If so:
	* When was the last time this component worked as expected in the browsers / devices that are encountering this issue?
	* Has there been any recent dev work or updates that you suspect could be causing / playing a role here? Any related work perhaps?

6. When applicable, please provide a screenshot showing the behavior working as expected vs the currently broken behavior being observed.
