Background can be added to any container. Part of the Bolt “Components” CSS framework that powers the [Bolt Design System](https://www.boltdesignsystem.com).

###### Install via NPM

```
npm install @bolt/components-background
```

## Description

Background allows Bolt to set an image inside of bands.

- Can set an image inside the band
- Can set background shapes
- Can set focus on the left
- Can set focus on the right
- Can set light, medium, or heavy opacity
- Can set a left, right, or center gradient

We recommend a max-width of `2880px` for full-bleed background images. This recommendation takes into consideration the common HD screen resolution of `1920x1080` and multiplies `1920` by `1.5`.
