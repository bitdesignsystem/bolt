# Background shapes testing steps

## Background shapes render as expected

- [ ] Each shape group should consist of 6 individual shapes arranged in a 3 x 2 grid
- [ ] Shapes within a shape group should not overlap one another
- [ ] Each shape group should have a unique set of shapes (e.g. shape group B should have different shapes from shape group A)
